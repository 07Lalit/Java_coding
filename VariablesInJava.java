                   Variables 
                   ---------
                   
-> As we study in maths let's assume we have given some  
   rectangle with its  length & breadth with name l & b 
   So these a & b are our variables or containers that will  
   store our value in the memory . 
   
-> In english variables means anything whose value can be change.

-> a=10 , b = 5 ;   # variables 
-> find its perimeter of this rect ? 

->  2 * (a+b)

                literals
                --------

-> so in programming this 2 is a literal because it's value is 
   fixed or same or universal it doesn't depend on a & b values .


-> So literal also of many types like  1,2,3,4,5.. these are number 
  literals .
  
->'a', 'b' , 'c' ... these are character literals .


-> So it math we declar variables like this a =10 , b=20 .. and so on..
-> but in programming like java we define variables differently .
   
   first we writes it's datatype  then its' name 
   
   example-:   int a = 10 ;
               String b = "lalit" ;
               float c = 22.3f ;
               


                                  Identifiers
                                  -----------
                                  
-> So the name of these varaibales , class , function ,.. these are 
   known as Identifiers in java. 
   
   
                                Memory 
                                ------ 
                                
->So in java any infomation,variables that our program contains 
  store in a memory .
  
-> Memory have a unique address or small blocks just like our house
  number in real scenrio . 
  
-> so these variables points this memory address where our data is 
  stored  & when we call these variables we will get our data stored 
  in the memory .
  
-> memory will occupy by our variables based on the datatype of variables
